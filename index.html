            While I was unable to complete all the graphs, the first two charts
            give reasonable answers to the first two questions about video games. The
            first bar graph displays the top 10 video games all time or by a given year,
            which can be toggled. The pie chart displays, for a given region, what
            video game genre sold best overall (most total units). While I was unable to
            get the labels formatted cleanly, I believe a pie chart was a helpful illustration
            for the breakdown of popularity across genres, even if pie charts can sometimes
            be misleading because it is difficult to compare slice size (why labels are good).

            The D3 library was instrumental in creating organized and dynamic graphs. It uses SVG's, which
            are better than HTML images (as the second, betterment.com article suggested) because you
            can access individual elements inside the graph and they work well with screen readers.
            It also enables you to manage complex front-end graphics from the backend, using mainly
            Javascript instead of HTML and CSS.
          </li>
          <li>
            D3 might not be the best tool if you are trying to use static visualizations or pre-made graphs,
            since it is a bit complicated. Simply creating visualizations in Excel or other software and
            embedding a picture in the webpage could be simpler.
